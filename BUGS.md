- Testing approach: Exploratory testing with focus on edge cases

## Bugs Found

(All reported bugs have been resolved)

## Additional Observations

### Positive Findings
1. ✅ Handles empty repositories gracefully
2. ✅ Properly truncates long commit messages in auto-bookmarks (30 char limit)
3. ✅ Handles special characters in bookmark names (/, ., -)
4. ✅ Works with deep stacks (tested up to 10 levels)
5. ✅ Handles empty commits without issues
6. ✅ Help text is comprehensive and clear
7. ✅ Dry-run mode works correctly (except for cleanup operations)

### Areas for Improvement
1. 📝 Add progress indicators for long operations
2. 📝 Consider adding --verbose flag for debugging
3. 📝 Add configuration file support for default settings
4. 📝 Improve error messages with suggested fixes
5. 📝 Add --force flag to bypass certain safety checks
6. 📝 Consider adding PR template support

### Edge Cases Handled Well
- Single bookmark stacks
- Empty commits
- Very long commit messages
- Special characters in bookmark names (except spaces, which jj prevents)
- Missing GitHub repo (fails gracefully)

## Testing Coverage

### Tested Scenarios
- ✅ Empty repository
- ✅ Single change
- ✅ Linear stacks (2-10 changes)
- ✅ Special characters in bookmarks
- ✅ Auto-bookmark creation
- ✅ Cleanup functionality
- ✅ Deep stacks (10+ levels)
- ✅ Empty commits
- ✅ Long commit messages
- ✅ Diamond/merge patterns
- ✅ Invalid authentication

- ⏳ Network failures during PR creation
- ⏳ GitHub API rate limiting
- ⏳ PR creation with large diffs
- ⏳ Integration with CI/CD systems
- ⏳ Different git remote configurations
- ⏳ Bookmarks with unicode characters
- ⏳ Stacks with conflicts
